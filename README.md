# googleColab-cadaSimulator
"cadaSimulator" is a simulator to calculate the ex-post consumption rate (= ex-ante match size/the number of all capacities). This simulator is expected to be run on the enviroment of Google Colab. The consumption rates of DA-STB and DA-MTB will be derived simultaneously. After calculating consumption rate, the graph to compare above 3 ways will be drawn.

# DEMO
